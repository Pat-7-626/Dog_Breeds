How to run the program?: Go to main.py, then run the file.

The one important feature in my proposal: The histogram of all level of Intelligence, Adaptability, and Friendliness. (It's in Data Storytelling Results.)

User Interaction: a user can filter the population of all level of Intelligence, Adaptability, and Friendliness each by each topic.
